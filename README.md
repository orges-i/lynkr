LYNKR

LYNKR is a modular link-in-bio platform built with a component-driven architecture, focusing on customization, visual fidelity, and extensibility. The project is designed as a configurable system rather than a static link list, enabling the composition of a single page from interactive and media-rich modules.

The application emphasizes modern frontend patterns, real-time editing, and advanced visual effects, supported by a scalable backend for authentication, data persistence, and analytics.
